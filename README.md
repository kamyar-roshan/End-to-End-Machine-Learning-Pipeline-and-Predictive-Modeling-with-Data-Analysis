1. Data Exploration: Exploring the dataset to identify any missing values, duplicates, outliers, and other anomalies. Also, checking for the distribution of data across variables and look for any trends or patterns that might emerge.

Data Cleaning: Cleaning the dataset by addressing any issues identified during the exploration phase. This involves filling in missing values, removing duplicates and outliers, and transforming variables as needed.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on the existing ones in the dataset. These include derived features, interaction terms, or categorical variables that capture important aspects of the data.

Data Splitting: Splitting the dataset into training, validation , and test sets to prevent overfitting and evaluate the performance of the model.

Model Training: Using the training set to fit two models (Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines) to the data. This involves iterating over the training set, adjusting the model parameters, and evaluating the performance on the validation set.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the testing set to get an estimate of its real-world performance. This involves computing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
